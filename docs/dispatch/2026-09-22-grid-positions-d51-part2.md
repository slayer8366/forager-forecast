# forager-forecast: grid positions, part 2. Exact-tie direction and off-grid area extraction (D46, D51)

## Role

You are the coder. This is a verify-and-report follow-up in **slayer8366/forager-forecast**, appended to branch `grid-positions-d51`. You change no source code and make no design decisions. Any gap is a stop-and-ask.

The owner has delegated planning decisions to the planner with loose restrictions (2026-09-22). That delegation does not cover permission gates: if one blocks you, stop and report.

## Base and state

Premises. Verify each one before relying on it.

**forager-forecast**
- `origin/grid-positions-d51` = `0212760bc7525d79e391198a3cc92520ea8130b1`, 3 commits on main `82f28b6`.
- Its worktree is `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast-grid-positions-d51`.
- Part 1's report is at `docs/audits/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51-report.md` on that branch. Read it first.
- Part 1 found:
  - ERA5-Land daily statistics (`derived-era5-land-daily-statistics`) are delivered at multiples of 0.1°.
  - ERA5 single-levels daily statistics (`derived-era5-single-levels-daily-statistics`) are delivered at multiples of 0.25°.
  - Both use -180 to 180 longitudes.
  - Those pulls used area `[47.5,-123.5,46.5,-122.5]`, whose edges lie on both grids, so they cannot tell grid anchoring from corner anchoring.
- The request JSONs for both pulls are in `docs/pulls/grid-positions/`. Reuse their shape exactly, changing only `area`. Part 1 quoted the store's schema as the source of that shape.
- Client: `cdsapi==0.7.7`, run with `uv run --no-project --with` from `/tmp`.
- CDS credentials are in `~/.cdsapirc`. Never print them.
- The only exact tie part 1 probed was the 0.25° one at (47.125, -123.125). There Open-Meteo `era5` returned 47.25, -123.0.
- `src/forager_forecast/cells.py`:
  - `_tenths` (`:39`) rounds halves away from zero (`Decimal` `ROUND_HALF_UP`) on `Decimal(repr(value))`.
  - `cell_for` is at `:44`.
  - `GRID_STEP_DEGREES` = 0.1 (`:16`).
- Do not touch the unpushed d55 merge `c0fd3fb` or `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast-merge-d55`.

**Forager record**
- Worktree: `/home/zynergy-labs/Zynergy/Forager/.claude/worktrees/bridge-cse_01Md1NYxk9qgG8y6g7CiSm3y`.
- Branch tip `61ee4bf`, pushed.
- The only open intent is `2026-09-23-07`. It is not yours to close.

## Scope boundary

**In forager-forecast, on `grid-positions-d51` only, in new commits:**

1. **File this dispatch** at `docs/dispatch/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51-part2.md`: its preserved prompt, byte-identical except that the hook header is stripped. Add an index row saying so.

2. **Open-Meteo exact-tie probe.** Use the same URL form and D25 pins as part 1, one day 2024-06-01, `daily=precipitation_sum,temperature_2m_mean`. Every coordinate below is exactly representable in binary floating point, so each tie is exact.

   (a) `models=era5_land`, exact 0.1° ties. Probe these points (lat, lon):

   | Point | Kind of tie |
   |---|---|
   | (47.25, -123.22) | lat tie |
   | (47.75, -123.22) | lat tie |
   | (47.22, -123.25) | lon tie |
   | (47.22, -123.75) | lon tie |
   | (47.25, -123.25) | both |
   | (47.75, -123.75) | both |
   | (49.25, -120.75) | both |
   | (47.22, -123.22) | control, no tie |

   (b) `models=era5`, exact 0.25° ties. Probe these points (lat, lon):

   | Point | Kind of tie |
   |---|---|
   | (47.125, -123.1) | lat tie |
   | (47.375, -123.1) | lat tie |
   | (47.1, -123.125) | lon tie |
   | (47.1, -123.375) | lon tie |
   | (47.125, -123.125) | both, repeat of part 1 |
   | (48.625, -120.875) | both |
   | (47.1, -123.1) | control |

   Record the returned `latitude`/`longitude` for every point. For each tie axis, state whether the returned coordinate went toward +∞, toward −∞, toward zero or away from zero.

   Also compute `cell_for` on each 0.1° point using the committed module, run read-only with `uv run python -c` in the worktree. Mark agreement with Open-Meteo `era5_land`.

3. **CDS off-grid area.** Repeat both part 1 pulls with only `area` changed to `[47.47, -123.47, 46.53, -122.53]`. Those edges are on neither grid.
   - With a scratch reader (`netCDF4` via `uv run --with`, not committed), report per grid: first and last lat and lon, the step, and whether every point is on a multiple of the step, tested in `Decimal` after rounding to 9 places.
   - Report whether the point set is the part 1 set clipped to the new box, or a shifted set.
   - Store the request JSONs, with request time and the account (by reference to `cds-credentials-report.md:37`, as part 1 did), under `docs/pulls/grid-positions/` with `-offgrid` in the filename.
   - Delivered files go only under gitignored `data/`.

4. **Report** at `docs/audits/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51-part2-report.md`, with an index row.
   - Tables for items 2 and 3.
   - A plain statement of the tie rule observed per model per axis, or "no single rule" if the results are mixed.
   - The fact that D51's deduction is confirmed or refuted by item 3.
   - Interpret nothing beyond that: no recommendation for the cell code.

**In Forager, following the record protocol:** sweep (if anything is unclaimed), then your intent claiming this dispatch's preserved prompt, then your terminal entry. Push the branch.

**Push:** push `grid-positions-d51`. Merge nothing.

## Closed decisions

These are the planner's, under the owner's delegation:
- Verify only: no edit to `src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`.
- The request shape is exactly as in part 1's stored JSONs. Only `area` changes.
- Part 1's `frequency` `1_hourly` and `product_type` `reanalysis` stand for this pull. Their ruling is left for the D32 dispatch's decision rows.
- The test account (D43) is used.
- Evidence standard: every position comes from a returned field or a delivered file.
- Part 1's `time_shift` and null-precipitation observations are not investigated here.

## Prediction

**Mechanism.** These are expectations, and a mismatch is a finding:
- Open-Meteo resolves exact ties toward +∞ on both axes, for both models. Part 1's single 0.25° tie did that.
- Where that holds at 0.1°, `cell_for`'s away-from-zero rule disagrees with Open-Meteo on negative-longitude ties, and agrees on positive-latitude ties.
- The off-grid CDS pull returns points on multiples of the step, clipped to the box, so D51's deduction is confirmed.

**Outcome.** A per-axis tie rule for each model, and a yes or no on D51's deduction, each with the evidence behind it.

## Finish line and abort conditions

**Finish line:**
- `grid-positions-d51` is pushed with the dispatch, the stored requests, the part 2 report and the index rows.
- The Forager entries are pushed, and both checkers pass.
- A report is delivered.

**Abort and report** if any of these happens:
- `origin/grid-positions-d51` is not `0212760`.
- The store asks for terms. Never accept them.
- A job is queued over 30 minutes. Record the id and use one background wait.
- A file over 1 MB, or a delivered file, would be committed.
- Any secret would appear anywhere.
- A permission gate blocks you.
- A new unclaimed preserved prompt appears whose outcome you haven't seen.

## Checks

Quote each of these:
1. `git rev-parse origin/grid-positions-d51` at the start.
2. Every Open-Meteo URL and its returned coordinates, plus the `cell_for` output for each 0.1° point.
3. Each CDS request JSON, the job id and status, the file size, and the coordinate summary.
4. The secret check over tracked files: the CDS key and the `GBIF_PWD` value, as counts only.
5. `git ls-remote origin grid-positions-d51`.
6. The Forager checkers' output before each commit that touches `RECORD.md`.

## Out of scope

- Any code change.
- A recommendation.
- `time_shift`.
- The D24 equivalence test.
- Merging.
- The d55 merge.
- `history_guard`.
- Accepting terms.
- Requests beyond those listed.

## Device items

None.
