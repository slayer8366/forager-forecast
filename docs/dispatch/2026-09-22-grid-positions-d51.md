# forager-forecast: confirm the climate grids' point positions from delivered data (D46, D51, D54). Revision 2.

## Role

You are the coder. This is a verify-and-report task in **slayer8366/forager-forecast**:
- pull tiny samples;
- read the coordinates the sources actually deliver;
- check the existing cell code against them;
- file a report on a branch.

You change no source code. You make no design decisions; any gap is a stop-and-ask.

The owner has delegated planning decisions to the planner with loose restrictions (chat, 2026-09-22). That delegation does not cover permission gates: if one blocks you, stop and report.

This revision replaces the dispatch preserved at `prompts/preserved/2026-09-23-06.md`. That dispatch stopped before its intent because it named no request shape for the daily-statistics datasets. This revision closes that gap (scope item 3) and corrects one wording error.

## Base and state

Premises. Verify each one.

**forager-forecast**
- `origin/main` = `82f28b65e1c46148c0518e30b411428ee0a7e2bb`, re-read by the previous coder on 2026-09-22.
- A local merge `c0fd3fb` of `d55-artifact-contract` is unpushed and waits on the owner. Do not push it, and do not touch `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast-merge-d55`.
- If `origin/main` has moved to `c0fd3fb`, base on it and say so.

**Rows in `docs/planning/DECISIONS.md` on main** (line numbers confirmed by the previous coder):
- D54 at `:8` names the two grids: ERA5-Land at 0.1° for temperature and soil; ERA5 single-levels daily statistics at 0.25° for precipitation, as the daily sum over the UTC day. Each record goes to each grid's nearest point separately.
- D52 at `:10`: every climate pull records its time and account beside the stored request. Daily-statistics requests pin the UTC day boundary, with no shift.
- D51 at `:11`: grid positions come from delivered data only. For a CDS pull that means the delivered file's coordinate arrays. For Open-Meteo it means the returned `latitude`/`longitude`, under D25's pins.
- D46 at `:16`: the grid is confirmed before D32's follow-up task.
- D43 at `:19`: the CDS account is a test account.
- D36/D39: no secret in any file, commit or output.

**Code**
- `src/forager_forecast/cells.py`: `cell_for` is at `:44`. It rounds to the nearest 0.1° centre with `Decimal` `ROUND_HALF_UP`, which rounds halves **away from zero**: -123.05 goes to -123.1. That rule lives in `_tenths` at `:39`. `cell_for` rejects any longitude outside -180 to 180 (`:48`). The docstring at `:3-8` cites two Open-Meteo observations from 2026-09-18.
- `src/forager_forecast/open_meteo.py:59-61` pins `elevation=nan`, `cell_selection=nearest`, `timezone=UTC`.
- No 0.25° code exists.

**CDS evidence**
- `docs/planning/evidence/cds-credentials-report.md:21-22` gives the dataset ids.
- `:25-27` gives the only known request shape, for `reanalysis-era5-land` hourly.
- `:27-29` says to build each other dataset's request from that dataset's own form.
- `:96-98` says no request to the other three datasets has ever been tried.
- `:17` gives `cdsapi>=0.7.7`, which is not exact.
- `~/.cdsapirc` exists, 85 bytes, mode 600. Do not print it.

**Workspace**
- `.gitignore` excludes `data/` and `*.nc`. `docs/pulls/` and `docs/dispatch/` exist.
- Work in a new worktree of `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast-t0b`, on a new branch `grid-positions-d51` cut from `origin/main`.
- Never write into `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast`.

**Forager record**
- Worktree: `/home/zynergy-labs/Zynergy/Forager/.claude/worktrees/bridge-cse_01Md1NYxk9qgG8y6g7CiSm3y`.
- The branch tip is `19b5010` (pushed), with dispatch-note `2026-09-23-09` claiming `preserved/2026-09-23-05.md`.
- `preserved/2026-09-23-06.md` is untracked and unclaimed.
- Intent `2026-09-23-07` is open and **not yours to close**. It waits on the owner pushing `c0fd3fb`.

## Scope boundary

**In forager-forecast, on `grid-positions-d51` only:**

1. **File this dispatch** at `docs/dispatch/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51.md`. It must be byte-identical to this dispatch's preserved prompt, minus the hook's header lines; the index row says the header was stripped. Also file the stopped revision 1, from `preserved/2026-09-23-06.md` minus its header, at `docs/dispatch/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51-rev1.md`. Append a dated D41 closeout note inside it: stopped before any work at scope item 3 (no request shape), and superseded by this file.
2. **Open-Meteo probe.**
   - Archive requests under D25's pins (`elevation=nan`, `cell_selection=nearest`, `timezone=UTC`).
   - One day, 2024-06-01, with `daily=precipitation_sum,temperature_2m_mean`.
   - Run `models=era5_land` and `models=era5` separately at each probe point.
   - Record the returned `latitude`/`longitude`.
   - Under `docs/pulls/grid-positions/`, store the exact URLs, the request time, and "no account (Open-Meteo is keyless)".
3. **Build the CDS requests from the store's own schema.**
   - For each daily-statistics dataset, read its request schema from the store itself: the dataset's API process description (the `retrieve/v1/processes/<dataset-id>` endpoint on the CDS API host that `cdsapi`/`~/.cdsapirc` targets; read the host without printing the key), or the dataset's download form ("Show API request code").
   - Quote in the report the source URL, its read time, and the exact field names and allowed values you used for variable, statistic, time zone, frequency, product type, date and area.
   - Choose values only where D54 or D52 fixes them:
     - (a) ERA5-Land daily statistics: `2m_temperature`, daily mean.
     - (b) ERA5 single-levels daily statistics: `total_precipitation`, daily sum.
     - Both: time zone UTC+00:00 with no shift; the frequency the schema offers for the base data; one day, 2024-06-01; an area of about 1° around 47°N, -123°.
   - Where the schema forces a choice that neither row fixes, stop and report it. Do not pick.
4. **Pull both**, with `uv run --with cdsapi==<current release>` and no change to the project. Record the version.
   - Store each request JSON, with its time and the account identifier (never the key), under `docs/pulls/grid-positions/`.
   - Delivered files go under the gitignored `data/` only.
5. **Read the delivered coordinate arrays** with an uncommitted scratch read (`uv run --with` for the reader). For each grid, record:
   - the first and last latitude and longitude;
   - the step;
   - the longitude convention;
   - whether the points sit on multiples of the step.
6. **Check the cell code.** For each probe point, compare `cell_for` against the nearest delivered 0.1° point and Open-Meteo's `era5_land` centre. For the 0.25° grid, give the nearest delivered point and Open-Meteo's `era5` centre. `cell_for` has no 0.25° mode: report that as a finding, not a fix.
7. **Report** at `docs/audits/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51-report.md`, with index rows appended for the two dispatches and the report.

**Probe points (lat, lon):**
- (47.049, -123.049)
- (47.05, -123.05)
- (47.051, -123.051)
- (47.125, -123.125)
- (47.12, -123.13)
- (47.13, -123.12)
- (47.2, -123.2)

**In Forager, following the record protocol:**
1. The sweep: a dispatch-note for `preserved/2026-09-23-06.md` with `Outcome: declined` and `Report: none; the coder stopped before its intent at scope item 3 (no request shape for the daily-statistics datasets) and handed the gap back; superseded by revision 2`. The outcome is the planner's ruling under the owner's delegation.
2. Your intent, claiming this dispatch's own preserved prompt.
3. Your terminal entry.
4. Push the Forager branch.

**Push** `grid-positions-d51`. Merge nothing: D40 requires the owner.

## Closed decisions

These are planner decisions under the owner's delegation, 2026-09-22:
- The grid check runs before D32's unification, as its own task.
- Verify only: no edit to `src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`.
- The request shape comes from the store's own schema (option B from revision 1's stop).
- The datasets stay as D54 names them. Do **not** switch to the hourly products.
- The pulls use the test account (D43).
- The `06` note reads as worded above. `07` stays open.
- Evidence standard: every position number comes from a delivered file or a returned API field, quoted with where it came from. It never comes from documentation.

## Prediction

**Mechanism.** These are expectations, and a mismatch is a finding:
- ERA5-Land points sit at multiples of 0.1°, and ERA5 at multiples of 0.25°.
- CDS longitudes may arrive as 0 to 360 or as -180 to 180 for an area request; which one is unknown.
- Open-Meteo `era5_land` returns 0.1° centres that match `cell_for`, including at the halves.
- Open-Meteo `era5` returns 0.25° centres.

**Outcome.** A per-point table showing whether the current code's nearest-point assignment agrees with delivered positions, for each grid, with every disagreement named.

## Finish line and abort conditions

**Finish line:**
- `grid-positions-d51` is pushed, carrying: both dispatch files, the stored requests with their times and account, the report, and the index rows.
- The Forager entries are committed and pushed, and both checkers pass.
- A report is delivered.

**Abort and report if:**
- CDS credentials are missing, or the store asks you to accept terms. Never accept terms on the owner's behalf.
- The schema forces an unfixed choice.
- A job is queued for more than 30 minutes. In that case record the job id and report. Use one background wait, not a tight polling loop.
- A delivered file, or anything over 1 MB, would be committed.
- A secret would appear anywhere.
- A permission gate blocks you.
- A new unclaimed preserved prompt appears whose outcome you have not seen.

## Checks

Quote each of these:
1. `git rev-parse origin/main` at the start.
2. Each Open-Meteo URL, with its returned `latitude`/`longitude`.
3. The schema source URLs and the field excerpts used. Then, per CDS pull: the request JSON, the job id and status, the file name and size, and the coordinate first/last values and step.
4. A table: probe point → `cell_for` → nearest delivered 0.1° point → Open-Meteo `era5_land` → nearest delivered 0.25° point → Open-Meteo `era5`, with agreement marked.
5. A secret check over the branch's tracked files: the CDS key value and the `GBIF_PWD` value, counts only, never the values.
6. `git ls-remote origin grid-positions-d51`.
7. The Forager checkers' output before each `RECORD.md` commit.

## Out of scope

- Any code change, including the cell code and 0.25° handling.
- The D24 equivalence test.
- Merging.
- The d55 merge.
- `history_guard`.
- Accepting CDS terms.
- Requests larger than those specified.

## Device items

None.
