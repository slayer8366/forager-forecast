# forager-forecast: confirm the climate grids' point positions from delivered data (D46, D51, D54), before D32's follow-up

## Role

You are the coder. This is a verify-and-report task in **slayer8366/forager-forecast**:
- pull tiny samples;
- read the coordinates the sources actually deliver;
- check the existing cell code against them;
- file a report on a branch.

You change no source code. You make no design decisions. Any gap is a stop-and-ask.

The owner has delegated planning decisions to the planner with loose restrictions (chat, 2026-09-22). That delegation does **not** cover permission gates. If one blocks you, stop and report.

## Base and state

Premises from the planner's read at forager-forecast `82f28b6` on 2026-09-22. Verify each one.

**Branch state**
- `origin/main` = `82f28b65e1c46148c0518e30b411428ee0a7e2bb`.
- A merge `c0fd3fb` of `d55-artifact-contract` is built locally but is **not pushed**. Leave it alone: do not push it, and do not touch `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast-merge-d55`.
- If `origin/main` has moved to `c0fd3fb` when you start, base on that instead and say so.

**Decisions that bind this task** (all in `docs/planning/DECISIONS.md` on main)
- **D46 (line 16):** "Before D32's follow-up task unifies the pipelines, the grid's point positions are confirmed … and the cell code is checked against them." Records go to the nearest grid point.
- **D51 (line 11)** replaces the method. The source must be delivered data:
  - For a Climate Data Store (CDS) pull, use the coordinate arrays of the delivered file.
  - For Open-Meteo, use the latitude and longitude the API returns as the centre of the cell it used, under D25's pinned parameters.
- **D54 (line 8)** names two grids:
  - Temperature and soil: ERA5-Land at 0.1°.
  - Precipitation: the ERA5 single-levels daily statistics at 0.25°, as the daily sum over the UTC day.
  - Each record is matched to each grid's nearest point separately.
- **D52 (line 10):** every climate pull records, beside its stored request, the date and time it was made and the account that made it. Daily-statistics requests pin the UTC day boundary with no shift.
- **D43 (line 19):** the CDS account is a test account.
- **D36/D39:** no secret ever appears in any file, commit or report. Identifiers are allowed.

**Cell code**
- `src/forager_forecast/cells.py:44` `cell_for` rounds to the nearest 0.1° centre, rounding halves up, using `_tenths` at `:39`.
- It rejects longitudes outside -180 to 180 (`:48`).
- Its docstring (`:3-8`) cites two Open-Meteo observations on 2026-09-18:
  - 47.049, -123.049 → 47.0, -123.0
  - 47.05, -123.05 → 47.1, -123.1
- Whether those used D25's pins is unverified.

**Open-Meteo code**
- `src/forager_forecast/open_meteo.py` builds the archive URL with D25's pins at about `:59-61`: `elevation=nan`, `cell_selection=nearest`, and a UTC timezone.
- No code handles a 0.25° grid anywhere.

**Stored-request practice and CDS details**
- `docs/pulls/` holds stored GBIF queries.
- `docs/planning/evidence/cds-credentials-report.md` holds the CDS dataset ids, a working request shape, and a `cdsapi` version note.
- The CDS credential location is on this machine and is not in the repo. Find it without printing it.

**Rules and branch**
- `docs/audits/README.md` is the index, and rows are appended only.
- Dispatches are filed in `docs/dispatch/` under D41, byte-identical to the original.
- Work in a new worktree of `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast-t0b` on a new branch `grid-positions-d51` cut from `origin/main`. Never write into `~/Zynergy/forager-forecast`.

**Forager record** (this dispatch is recorded in Forager `RECORD.md`, as the owner ruled; worktree `/home/zynergy-labs/Zynergy/Forager/.claude/worktrees/bridge-cse_01Md1NYxk9qgG8y6g7CiSm3y`)
- `prompts/preserved/2026-09-23-05.md` is unclaimed. It is the hook-change build the previous coder stopped on before doing any work.
- Intent `2026-09-23-07` is open. It waits on the owner pushing `c0fd3fb`, and it is **not** yours to close.

## Scope boundary

**In forager-forecast, on branch `grid-positions-d51` only:**

1. **File this dispatch.** Copy it to `docs/dispatch/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51.md`, byte-identical to this dispatch's preserved prompt with the hook's header lines removed. Say in the index row that the header was stripped.
2. **Open-Meteo probe.** Make archive requests under D25's pins (`elevation=nan`, `cell_selection=nearest`, UTC) for one day, 2024-06-01, `daily=precipitation_sum,temperature_2m_mean`.
   - Run `models=era5_land` and `models=era5` separately, at each probe point below.
   - Record the returned `latitude` and `longitude` for each.
   - Store the exact request URLs, the request time and "no account (Open-Meteo is keyless)" under `docs/pulls/grid-positions/`.
3. **CDS pulls.** Make the smallest requests the store accepts: one day (2024-06-01), UTC, an area of about 1° around 47°N −123°, one variable each.
   - (a) The ERA5-Land daily-statistics dataset, `2m_temperature` daily mean.
   - (b) The ERA5 single-levels daily-statistics dataset, `total_precipitation` daily sum.

   Take the dataset ids and request shape from the CDS evidence report, and quote the line you used.

   Run cdsapi without adding it to the project: `uv run --with cdsapi==<exact version>`. Use the version the evidence report names if it is exact. Otherwise use the current release, and record which.

   Store each request JSON with its time and the account identifier (never the key) under `docs/pulls/grid-positions/`. Delivered files go under the gitignored `data/` and are never committed.
4. **Read the delivered coordinate arrays**, from the NetCDF or GRIB, with a scratch read (`uv run --with` for the reader) that is not committed. For each grid, record:
   - the first and last latitude and longitude values;
   - the step;
   - the longitude convention (0 to 360, or -180 to 180);
   - whether the points sit on multiples of the step.
5. **Check the cell code.** For each probe point, compare `cell_for`'s result with the nearest delivered 0.1° point and with Open-Meteo's `era5_land` centre. For the 0.25° grid, report the nearest delivered point and Open-Meteo's `era5` centre. `cell_for` has no 0.25° mode; that is a finding, not something to fix.
6. **Report** at `docs/audits/2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51-report.md`, plus one appended index row.

**Probe points** (lat, lon), chosen at and near halves of both grids:
- (47.049, -123.049)
- (47.05, -123.05)
- (47.051, -123.051)
- (47.125, -123.125)
- (47.12, -123.13)
- (47.13, -123.12)
- (47.2, -123.2)

**In Forager:** follow the record protocol.
1. The sweep: a `dispatch-note` for `2026-09-23-05` with `Outcome: declined` and `Report: none; the coder stopped before any work because the hook edit's authorisation reached it only through the planner; see the planner's chat of 2026-09-22`. This outcome is the planner's ruling under the owner's delegation.
2. Your intent, claiming this dispatch's prompt.
3. Your terminal entry.
4. Push the Forager branch.

**Push:** push `grid-positions-d51` to origin. Nothing merges to main: D40 needs the owner.

## Closed decisions

- **The grid check comes before the D32 unification, as its own task.** Planner decision under the owner's delegation, 2026-09-22.
- **Verify only.** No edit to `src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`.
- **The pulls use the test account** (D43). Nothing is redone later for this.
- **The `05` note's outcome is `declined`, as worded above.** Leave `07` open.
- **Evidence standard:** a number in the report comes from a delivered file or a returned API field, quoted with where it came from. It never comes from documentation. That is D51's whole point.

## Prediction

**Mechanism.** These are expectations and may be wrong. A mismatch is a finding, not a failure.
- ERA5-Land points sit at multiples of 0.1°, and the ERA5 single-levels points at multiples of 0.25°.
- CDS longitudes may arrive as 0 to 360, or as -180 to 180 for an area request. Which one is unknown.
- Open-Meteo `era5_land` returns 0.1° centres. For each probe point that centre matches `cell_for`, including the halves at 47.05/-123.05.
- Open-Meteo `era5` returns 0.25° centres.

**Outcome.** The report shows, for every probe point and each grid, whether nearest-point assignment by the current code agrees with delivered positions. Any disagreement is named with the point.

## Finish line and abort conditions

**Finish line:**
- `grid-positions-d51` is pushed. It holds:
  - the filed dispatch;
  - the stored requests with times and account;
  - the report;
  - the index row.
- The Forager record entries are committed, pushed and pass both checkers.
- A report is delivered.

**Abort and report if:**
- No CDS credentials are found, or the store refuses the licence or terms. **Do not accept any terms on the owner's behalf.**
- A pull is queued for longer than 30 minutes. Stop waiting, record the request id, and report. Do not poll in a tight loop: one background wait, and check once.
- A delivered file would need committing, or any file over 1 MB would be committed.
- Any secret would appear in output or files.
- A permission gate blocks an action.
- A new unclaimed preserved prompt appears whose outcome you have not seen.

## Checks

Quote the output of each:

1. `git rev-parse origin/main` at the start.
2. Each Open-Meteo request URL and its returned `latitude`/`longitude`.
3. For each CDS pull:
   - the request JSON;
   - the job id and status;
   - the delivered file's name and size;
   - the coordinate first and last values and the step, from the scratch read's output.
4. A table: probe point → `cell_for` → nearest delivered 0.1° point → Open-Meteo `era5_land` centre → nearest delivered 0.25° point → Open-Meteo `era5` centre, with agreement marked.
5. A secret check over the branch's tracked files: grep for the CDS key's literal value and the `GBIF_PWD` value. Counts only; never print a value.
6. `git ls-remote origin grid-positions-d51`.
7. The Forager checkers' output before each `RECORD.md` commit.

## Out of scope

- Any code change, including to the cell code or the 0.25° handling. Those go to the D32 follow-up.
- The D24 equivalence test.
- Merging anything.
- The d55 merge.
- `history_guard`.
- Accepting CDS terms.
- Requests larger than the ones specified.

## Device items

None.

End with **Decisions I made** and **Flags outside scope**.

**Closed without action, 2026-09-22.** Appended by the revision 2 coder under D41, from the planner's
account in revision 2 and the Forager record entry that answers this dispatch (dispatch-note
2026-09-23-10, outcome declined, on branch worktree-bridge-cse_01Md1NYxk9qgG8y6g7CiSm3y). The coder
stopped before its intent and before any work, at scope item 3 (the planner's account; not observed by this coder): the dispatch named no request shape
for the two daily-statistics datasets, and the coder handed that gap back. Nothing was pulled,
filed or pushed under it, by the same account; no grid-positions-d51 branch existed on the remote when revision 2 began. Superseded by revision 2,
`2026-09-22-grid-positions-d51.md`, which closes the gap by building the requests from the store's
own schema. Nothing above this note is edited.
